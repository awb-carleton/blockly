# Blockly

A fork of Google's Blockly project for use in an ongoing research project.
Includes several feature additions/changes, all of which happen on the *ruthefjord* branch.

The build file to use is <code>mybuild.py</code>. The original build script from master is preserved in this branch, but never used.
